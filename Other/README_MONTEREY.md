# MacOS Monterey on ThinkPad X230

## Install

### Update from MacOS Big Sur

- If you are already using previous EFI release from our repository and running MacOS Big Sur, just download one of the update from [link](https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-12-monterey-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/
).
- Once downloaded the installer also download the latest EFI release (April-2K22 Update).
- Now you have to start the installer and follow the on screen instruction and wait till it completes. It sure takes a lot of time so grab a cup of coffee.
- Once the update is installed, don't restart your laptop. Now is the time to put the EFI release we downloaded to the EFI partition of your MacOS. To do that:

#### MOUNTING EFI 

- Discover the volume identifier for your EFI boot partition. Run this command:

  ```bash
    diskutil list
  ```

- The output should look something like this:

  ```bash
    /dev/disk0
    #: TYPE                     NAME          SIZE       IDENTIFIER
    0: GUID_partition_scheme                  *251.0 GB  disk0
    1: EFI                                    209.7 MB   disk0s1
    2: Apple_HFS                Macintosh HD  250.1 GB   disk0s2
    3: Apple_Boot               Recovery HD   650.0 MB   disk0s3
  ```

- In this case, the volume identifier of the EFI partition is disk0s1

- Mount the volume using the command:

  ```bash
    sudo diskutil mount disk0s1
  ```

- Now copy paste only the EFI folder from the release file to the EFI partition.
- Now it is time to restart your laptop. After the restart you may see weird graphics. So follow the graphics fix section to finish.


### New Installation

- For making the usb follow dortania's guide to setup bootable MacOs Monterey Usb.(Only do the recovery Installer part and we dont need the EFI part).
- Once you have made the bootable usb. Just Copy paste the EFI from our latest release to the root folder of the usb. Make sure you have a good internet connection (Both Ethernet and Wifi must work now. Thanks to the updated Kexts).
- Once installations is over follow the MOUNT_EFI Section of the Update MacOs. Once Done Follow the Below Guide to Fix Graphics.

### Intel HD 4000 Fix

- So In Monterey they have dropped a lot of supports which include Intel HD 4000. Thanks to @chris1111 for the Intel HD 4000 Patch.
- I have included the patch in the release file.
- Before going to the patch we have a few steps to follow.We Need to do this is recory mode. so turn off and boot into recovery mode

Once this is done boot back into MacOs Monterey

### Patch Intel HD 4000

- Open the App that comes with the release file. Intel HD 4000 app
- Follow the on screen instruction and install the patch. 
- You may end up with error 1712. It is just fine
  - The app closes. Dont worry. Wait for a minute or two and Do step 1 and 2 again.
  - This time it will throw a different error saysing the volume is busy. Never mind. Everything is working fine.
  - Now Reboot and you will see the magic. Intel Hd 4000 will work great. If not repeat step 1 and 2 and reboot again.
